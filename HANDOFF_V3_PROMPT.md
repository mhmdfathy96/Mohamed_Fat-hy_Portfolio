## About Me

I started my professional journey with a background in Civil Engineering, which helped me develop strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Over time, I transitioned into software engineering, driven by a genuine interest in building real systems that solve real problems.

For more than 4 years, I’ve worked on production applications used by real users across multiple countries, focusing primarily on mobile development with Flutter while working closely with backend systems and real-time services.

I’m comfortable owning features end-to-end — from planning and architecture to implementation, optimization, and delivery.

Alongside mobile development, I have hands-on experience working with backend technologies across both **Java and C# ecosystems**.

On the Java side, I work with **Spring Boot** for building RESTful APIs and backend services.

On the Microsoft stack, I have experience with **C#**, **.NET Core**, **ASP.NET Web APIs**, and **Entity Framework**, including database integration and backend API development.

I’m actively strengthening my backend and system design skills, aiming to grow into more backend-focused and full-stack engineering roles.

I’ve also had opportunities to lead and coordinate with cross-functional teams, collaborating closely with backend engineers and UI/UX designers, which helped me grow beyond just writing code.

Recently, I’ve been using AI tools extensively to accelerate research, debugging, and solution design — sometimes it honestly feels like having my own engineering team available 24/7.
