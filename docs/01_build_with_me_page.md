## SECTION: The Problem

Why Most SaaS Projects Stall

- Hiring developers takes months.
- Agencies overscope and inflate budgets.
- Freelancers lack architectural ownership.
- Managing multiple roles slows momentum.

Founders need focused execution and accountability.

## SECTION: The Solution

A Lean Product Execution Model

Instead of hiring and coordinating a full internal team, you work directly with a senior engineer who:

- Designs scalable architecture from day one
- Owns both mobile and backend delivery
- Ensures production-ready deployment
- Integrates additional specialists (UI/UX, QA, DevOps) when required

---
